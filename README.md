# Warp Terminal Theme
Going for a cyberpunk aesthetic. Based it off of Blue Monday theme in the warp terminal theme repo.
The image used is from ArtStation, I downloaded it a long time ago, so I forgot the artist's name, sorry.

To use this theme install it with:
```git clone git@github.com:Necryl/warp-terminal-theme.git $HOME/.local/share/warp-terminal/themes/.```
then close and reopen Warp ```Ctrl + Shift + P``` and pick the theme. The name is currently still Blue Monday.
